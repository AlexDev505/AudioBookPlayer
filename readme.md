**Audio Book Player** - an application for Windows that allows you to listen to and download audiobooks for free.

The application has access to all the books available on the websites [_akniga.org_](https://akniga.org/) and [_knigavuhe.org_](https://knigavuhe.org/).
These websites have huge libraries of audiobooks of various genres and authors,
but typically audiobook websites do not allow users to download their audiobooks..
**Audio Book Player** however, provides this opportunity for free without SMS and registration.
